I'm a third year undergraduate student in the [Department of Plamt Protection](http://www.cab.zju.edu.cn/cabzbenglish/main.htm) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My academic interests lie at the intersection of plant protection, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, with a particular focus on animal genome analysis and disease prevention.

Currently, I am conducting research in [Prof.Li's](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lifei) Lab at the College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University. Through this opportunity, I am working on a project titled “Chromosome-Level Genome Annotation Analysis of [*Formica fusca*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica_fusca), the silky black wood ant.” This research allows me to explore comparative genomics, transposable elements, and evolutionary relationships using bioinformatics techniques.
