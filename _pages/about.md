I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Department of Plamt Protection](http://www.cab.zju.edu.cn/cabzbenglish/main.htm) ,[Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). I am highly interested in research at the intersection of plant protection and bioinformatics, particularly in animal genome analysis and disease prevention.Fortunatly,  [Prof.Li's](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lifei) Lab from College of Agriculture and Biotechnology,Zhejiang University gives me a chance to do some research about Chromosome-level genome annotation analysis of [*Formica fusca*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica_fusca), the silky black wood ant.
